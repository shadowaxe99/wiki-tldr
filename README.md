# Wiki TLDR

Wiki TLDR is a React application that fetches and displays summarized versions of Wikipedia pages. 

## Setup and Installation

1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` in the project directory to install all the necessary dependencies listed in package.json.

2. **Backend Service**: Ensure that there is a backend service running on `http://localhost:5000` that can handle the `/search`, `/random`, and `/summarize` endpoints as these are used in the App.js file to fetch data.

3. **Environment Setup**: Make sure your development environment is set up for React development. This includes having Node.js installed.

4. **Start the Application**: Use the `npm start` command to start the development server. This should compile the React application and serve it on a local web server, typically accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

5. **Database/Storage**: If the application requires a database or any storage service, ensure that it is properly set up and configured to store and retrieve the necessary data.

6. **API Keys**: If the application requires any API keys for external services (not evident from the provided files), make sure they are obtained and configured properly.

## Testing

Test the application to ensure that all features are working as expected. This includes entering a Wikipedia page name, fetching a summary, and using the randomize feature.

## Deployment

For the application to be accessible on the web, you will need to deploy it to a web server or a cloud service provider.

## Error Handling

Ensure that proper error handling is in place for network requests and server responses.

## Security

Review the application for security vulnerabilities, particularly if it will be deployed publicly.
